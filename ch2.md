## First Glance of Visual SLAM

### Goal of Study

1.  Understand what modules a visual SLAM framework consists of, and what task each module carries out.
2.  Set up the programming environment, and prepare for development and experiments.
3.  Understand how to compile and run a program under Linux. If there is a problem, how to debug it.
4.  Master the basic use of cmake.

This lecture summarizes the structure of a visual SLAM system as an outline of subsequent chapters. Practice part introduces the fundamentals of environment setup and program development. We will complete a "Hello SLAM" program at the end.
