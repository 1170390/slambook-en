## Welcome to 14 Lectures on Visual SLAM: From Theory to Practice, by Xiang Gao, Tao Zhang, Qinrui Yan and Yi Liu

This is the English version of this book. If you are Chinese readers, please check [this page](https://item.jd.com/12077296218.html). Our code is in github: [code](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook). 

So far the English version is free as I havn't contacted any publishing house. It is translated from the Chinese version. We are still doing the translation, maybe for a few months.
